# üèîÔ∏è PeakHealth 
PeakHealth is an innovative, experimental early-warning application designed specifically to help monitor and assess the risk of altitude sickness for users with Garmin sport watches. The app provides real-time tracking of critical health metrics such as the user's arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels and altitude, enabling it to identify potential risks associated with high-altitude environments.

By continuously monitoring these factors, PeakHealth can alert users if their oxygen levels are dropping too rapidly or if they are ascending at a rate that increases the likelihood of altitude sickness. The app offers detailed statistical data that allows users to manually inspect their current acclimatization status, giving them valuable insights into how their body is adjusting to the altitude.

Additionally, PeakHealth provides predictive data about the expected changes in acclimatization based on the user's current ascent rate. This feature helps users make informed decisions about whether they should pause their ascent or take additional precautions to avoid altitude-related health issues. Whether you're an experienced mountaineer or a casual hiker, PeakHealth offers a proactive, data-driven approach to staying safe at high altitudes.
